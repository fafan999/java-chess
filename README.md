# Java Chess Game
## Project Description:

This is a Java-based chess game that allows two players to play against each other on the same computer. The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles and follows the standard rules of chess. The game includes features such as highlighting legal moves and checking for checkmate. The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Swing library.

## Installation:

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

After installing Java, you can clone the repository and run the **SuperChess.java** file.

## Usage:

To start the game, simply run the **SuperChess.java** file. The GUI will appear, and you can start playing by clicking on the pieces and dragging them to their desired locations. The game will automatically detect legal moves and check for checkmate.
